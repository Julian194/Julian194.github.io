# Day 3

Another day spent waiting in a government office and gym after so late start.

## Make course
I've been hearing a lot about make.com lately - it's an automation tool that's popular in the no-code space. Today I took their introduction fundamentals course to get an overview of the platform and its capabilities. I'm really impressed by how powerful and intuitive it is compared to alternatives like Zapier.

There's a potential freelancing opportunity where the previous developer used make.com and other no-code tools to build the solution, so I wanted to familiarize myself with it. I plan to continue with the advanced material tomorrow. It's fascinating to see how these no-code tools can essentially replace traditional programming for many use cases.

## Acquire course
I completed the second part of the Acquire.com course today, which focused on deal flow - essentially how to find good deals and listings. They covered some useful template solutions for cold emailing and introduced various brokers in the space. One interesting discovery was the Shopify Exchange Marketplace, which I hadn't heard of before. It's apparently a big player in the micro PE/acquire scene, specifically for Shopify apps. The instructor also went through what to look out for and best practices as a buyer. While a lot of it reinforced common knowledge, it was still interesting. The key takeaway was to use common sense when evaluating companies and do proper due diligence.

## YPSI 
I completed the second part of the YPSI text-based course today. This section focused on lesser-known factors that influence client success. The material covered topics like heavy metal exposure, electromagnetic fields, flexibility/mobility work, and sleep optimization. While mostly theoretical rather than practical, it was interesting to see these concepts align with what I learned during the in-person seminar I attended previously. The course provided good insights into these foundational health factors, though I would have appreciated more actionable recommendations.

## Coding 
For coding today, I got back into NestJS for backend development. I really like this framework - while it's JavaScript-based, its structure reminds me a lot of Spring Boot, which I've worked with for years. It feels natural but isn't as heavy as Spring Boot. I started building a simple backend application for tracking various health measurements and parameters. The idea is to create something for my personal use where I can track these metrics and get some analytics out of them. I've already completed the basic backend with some simple analytics functionality.

## What didn't get done
The book .. its not quite getting me excited enough. I think I might pause it for now.
