# Day 3

Another day spent waiting in a government office and gym after so late start.

## Make course
So again, make.com is an automation tool which is used a lot in the no-code space and I've been hearing a lot about it lately and wanted to check it out. So I took the introduction fundamentals course that they offer just to get an overview of the platform and what it can do and I think it's quite powerful. really looked into Zapier or like other alternatives but yeah it seems very cool and very intuitive and there is a potential freelancing gig that I might work on where the current guy that worked on it already used make and other no-code tools to basically make it make it work and Yeah, I just wanted to have a look and I'm gonna continue with the advanced material tomorrow and it seems like it can pretty much replace the whole programming language. 

## Acquire course
I completed the second part of the Acquire.com course today, which focused on deal flow - essentially how to find good deals and listings. They covered some useful template solutions for cold emailing and introduced various brokers in the space. One interesting discovery was the Shopify Exchange Marketplace, which I hadn't heard of before. It's apparently a big player in the micro PE/acquire scene, specifically for Shopify apps. The instructor also went through what to look out for and best practices as a buyer. While a lot of it reinforced common knowledge, it was still interesting. The key takeaway was to use common sense when evaluating companies and do proper due diligence.

## YPSI 
I completed the second part of the YPSI text-based course today. This section focused on lesser-known factors that influence client success. The material covered topics like heavy metal exposure, electromagnetic fields, flexibility/mobility work, and sleep optimization. While mostly theoretical rather than practical, it was interesting to see these concepts align with what I learned during the in-person seminar I attended previously. The course provided good insights into these foundational health factors, though I would have appreciated more actionable recommendations.

## Coding 
For coding today, I got back into NestJS for backend development. I really like this framework - while it's JavaScript-based, its structure reminds me a lot of Spring Boot, which I've worked with for years. It feels natural but isn't as heavy as Spring Boot. I started building a simple backend application for tracking various health measurements and parameters. The idea is to create something for my personal use where I can track these metrics and get some analytics out of them. I've already completed the basic backend with some simple analytics functionality.

## What didn't get done
The book .. its not quite getting me excited enough. I think I might pause it for now.
