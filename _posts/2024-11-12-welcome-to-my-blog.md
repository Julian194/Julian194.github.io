# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post. 
I'll write about the learnings of the day.

## Powerlist

I have utilized the powerlist to create focus. Keep in mind this is the first day. Maybe i did not yet choose the most high leverage tasks but it helped me focus on a few things throughout the day

## Acquire.com
I have been thinking about this before and now picking up on the idea again of a Microacquisition. 
I signed up for the marketplace yesterday to just browse through the offerings. In the onboarding email I received some tips on how to get started.
First there was a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu3zh5FOFME) to watch on how to use the platform. It was informative but nothing you cannot figure out on your own. In the video he mentioned an interesting resource though. 
This triggered some learning for me: Buying a piece of software is not only a new job / thing to work on but it should be viewed as an investment (pretty much like real estate). That in turn means that you probably need 
some things like:
- A very concrete idea of what your criteria is (as a dev its easy to just look at things that interest you but not really dive deep into the business aspect)
- A strategy on what you will do with the investment (growing and selling or simply developing it further and reaping the profits)

It also introduced me to some interesting metrics that i researched after to know what they mean:
- Cash-on-cash return
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- Net Negative Churn
- Seller Financing

If you want to check out the article - its really great!

## ONEARMY Open Source
Another Youtube Video introduced me to the Universe of [ONEARMY](https://www.onearmy.earth/)
I quickly figured out that they look for open source contributers for their [community platform](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and i felt intrigued to help (never did any Open Source)
So I started with setting up the project and picked a first issue to get started on. Familiarized myself with the codebase and tried some first changes.

## Apply for a freelance job
Found an interesting Ruby on Rails job from another Indiehacker the other day and prepped an application. 
I focused mostly on value that I could provide instead of just writing down all the coding languages that I can work in.

## GenAI Launchpad
Thats a project that came out of a Mastermind that I am participating in. Its mostly centered arount Data and AI and they launched a project to streamline GenAI projects.
I watched the ~70min intro video course and made some notes, setup the dev env and played around with the examples that they provide in the repository. 
I found the code really nicely strucutred and after working on a couple of these projects myself I can really appreciate the structure that they have come up with.

## Hardware Hacker
A [book](https://amzn.eu/d/ffYRMCr) that I bought recently. Goal was to read the first chapter - I'll update this with the summary of what I learned.

## Freelance Work
Got some freelance work to do for an invoicing system that I used to work on so I did some research on how to implement a small new feature.

## What didn't get done
- Improve domain model of my app StrengthStack
